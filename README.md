# TCP-IP-NETWORK-PROGRAMMING-AND-SERVER-CLIENT-COMMUNICATION-
Five flags are chosen from the map within two players on the map, and their coordinates are recorded, as I explained in the report, which deals with TCP-IP socket programming and the server-client interaction. Each player takes a turn picking a random location on the map and attempting to locate their opponent's flag there. It will be necessary to include 15 troops in the area surrounding the chosen location to win the game. One of the flags I selected, for instance, might have a coordinate of 295,315. My flag will have been taken if my adversary has 15 points or more and 15 points or fewer in any given location. All coordinates in this instance are between 280,300 and 310,330
